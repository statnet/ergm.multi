A set of extensions for the 'ergm' package to fit multilayer/multiplex/multirelational networks and samples of multiple networks. 'ergm'.multi is a part of the Statnet suite of packages for network analysis.

<!-- ## Public and Private repositories -->

<!-- To facilitate open development of the package while giving the core developers an opportunity to publish on their developments before opening them up for general use, this project comprises two repositories: -->
<!-- * A public repository `statnet/ergm.multi` -->
<!-- * A private repository `statnet/ergm.multi-private` -->

<!-- The intention is that all developments in `statnet/ergm.multi-private` will eventually make their way into `statnet/ergm.multi` and onto CRAN. -->

<!-- Developers and Contributing Users to the Statnet Project should read https://statnet.github.io/private/ for information about the relationship between the public and the private repository and the workflows involved. -->
