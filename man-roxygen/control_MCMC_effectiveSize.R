#'   Set `MCMC.effectiveSize` to a non-NULL value to adaptively
#'   determine the burn-in and the MCMC length needed to get the
#'   specified effective size; 50 is a reasonable value. In the
#'   adaptive MCMC mode, MCMC is run forward repeatedly
#'   (`MCMC.samplesize*MCMC.interval` steps, up to
#'   `MCMC.effectiveSize.maxruns` times) until the target effective
#'   sample size is reached or exceeded. After each run, the returned
#'   statistics are mapped to the estimating function scale, then a
#'   series of `MCMC.effectiveSize.points` possible burn-in points are
#'   considered, at
#'   `MCMC.effectiveSize.base^(1:MCMC.effectiveSize.points)` of the
#'   way into the sample, and the earliest one whose Geweke diagnostic
#'   produces a \eqn{p}-value less than
#'   `MCMC.effectiveSize.burnin.pval` is selected. The effective size
#'   of the post-burn-in sample is computed via Vats, Flegal, and
#'   Jones (2015), and compared to the target effective size. If it is
#'   not matched, the MCMC run is resumed, with the additional draws
#'   needed linearly extrapolated but weighted in favor of the
#'   baseline `MCMC.samplesize` by the weighting factor
#'   `MCMC.effectiveSize.damp` (higher = less damping). Lastly, if
#'   after an MCMC run, the number of samples equals or exceeds
#'   `2*MCMC.samplesize`, the chain will be thinned by 2 until it
#'   falls below that, while doubling `MCMC.interval`.
