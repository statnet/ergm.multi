USAGE

These files are exported by ergm.multi via R's LinkingTo: API, and
allow other R packages to extend ergm.multi's functionality. To make
use of them, add the following dependencies to your package's
DESCRIPTION file:

Depends: ergm.multi
LinkingTo: ergm.multi

and place a one-line C file (e.g., include_stubs.c) containing the
following one line in the src/ directory of your package:

#include "ergm.multi_stubs.c"

You will then be able to #include any of the exported header files,
use the macros, and call any functions they define.

If you make use of this functionality, please credit us and cite the
ergm.multi package. (See citation(ergm.multi) for instructions.)

STABILITY

Currently, the APIs are subject to change, and are planned to be
declared stable at version 1.0.
