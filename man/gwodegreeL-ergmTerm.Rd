\title{Geometrically weighted out-degree distribution}
\usage{
# binary: gwodegreeL(decay, fixed=FALSE, attrname=NULL, cutoff=30, levels=NULL, Ls=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{decay}{non-negative model parameter that is the same as theta_s in
equation (14) in Hunter (2007).}

\item{fixed}{specify if the value supplied for \code{decay} may be fixed (if \code{fixed=TRUE} ),
or it may be used as merely the starting value for the estimation
in a curved exponential family model (the default).}

\item{attrname}{if specified, then separate degree
statistics are calculated for nodes having each separate
value of the attribute.}

\item{cutoff}{only relevant if \code{fixed=FALSE} . In that case it only uses this
number of terms in computing the statistics to reduce the computational
burden. Its default value can also be controlled by the \code{gw.cutoff} term option control parameter. (See \code{\link{control.ergm}} .)}

\item{levels}{a list of layer specifications. If given, degree of a node
\code{i} is considered to be the number of edges in all layers,
combined.}

\item{Ls}{either a Layer Logic specification formula (c.f. Layer Logic section in the \code{\link[=Layer]{Layer()}} documentation) or a list thereof (constructed by \code{\link[=list]{list()}} or \code{\link[=c]{c()}}).}
}
\description{
This term adds one network statistic to the model
equal to the weighted out-degree distribution with decay parameter . This
term can only be used with directed networks.
