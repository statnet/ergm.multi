\title{Sample Space Constraints for Exponential-Family Random Graph Models}
\description{
  \code{\link{ergm}} is used to fit exponential-family random graph
  models (ERGMs), in which
  the probability of a given network, \eqn{y}, on a set of nodes is 
  \eqn{h(y) \exp\{\eta(\theta) \cdot
    g(y)\}/c(\theta)}, where
  \eqn{h(y)} is the reference measure (usually \eqn{h(y)=1}),
  \eqn{g(y)} is a vector of network statistics for \eqn{y},
  \eqn{\eta(\theta)} is a natural parameter vector of the same 
  length (with \eqn{\eta(\theta)=\theta} for most terms), and \eqn{c(\theta)} is the
  normalizing constant for the distribution.

  This page describes the constraints (the networks \eqn{y} for which \eqn{h(y)>0}) 
  that are included with the
  \code{\link[=ergm-package]{ergm}} package. Other packages may add new
  constraints.

\section{Constraints implemented in  the \code{\link[=ergm.multi-package]{ergm.multi}} package}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{blockdiag(attrname)} (dyad-independent)}{
      Force a block-diagonal structure (and its bipartite analogue) on
      the network. Only dyads \eqn{(i,j)} for which
      \code{attrname(i)==attrname(j)} can have edges.

      Note that the current implementation requires that blocks be
      contiguous for \dQuote{unipartite} graphs, and for bipartite
      graphs, they must be contiguous within a partition and must have
      the same ordering in both partitions. (They do not, however,
      require that all blocks be represented in both partitions, but
      those that overlap must have the same order.)

      If multiple block-diagonal constraints are given, or if
      \code{attrname} is a vector with multiple attribute names, blocks
      will be constructed on \emph{all} attributes matching.
