\title{A multilayer network representation.}
\usage{
Layer(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{layer specification, in one of three formats:
\enumerate{
\item An (optionally named) list of identically-dimensioned
networks.
\item Several networks as (optionally named) arguments.
\item A single network, a character vector, and an optional
logical vector. Then, the layers are values of the named edge
attributes. If the network is directed, the logical vector
specifies which of the layers should be treated as undirected.
}}
}
\value{
A network object with layer metadata.
}
\description{
A function for specifying the LHS of a multilayer (a.k.a. multiplex
a.k.a. multirelational a.k.a. multivariate) ERGM.
}
\examples{

data(florentine)

# Method 1: list of networks
flo <- Layer(list(m = flomarriage, b = flobusiness))
ergm(flo ~ L(~edges, ~m)+L(~edges, ~b))

# Method 2: networks as arguments
flo <- Layer(m = flomarriage, b = flobusiness)
ergm(flo ~ L(~edges, ~m)+L(~edges, ~b))

# Method 3: edge attributes:
flo <- flomarriage | flobusiness
flo[,, names.eval="m"] <- as.matrix(flomarriage)
flo[,, names.eval="b"] <- as.matrix(flobusiness)
flo <- Layer(flo, c("m","b"))
ergm(flo ~ L(~edges, ~m)+L(~edges, ~b))
